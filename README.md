# Adventure Works Power BI Project

## Description

Welcome to the Adventure Works Power BI Project repository! This project was completed as part of the Microsoft Power BI course by Maven Analytics. As a Business Intelligence Analyst, I had the opportunity to work with Adventure Works, a global manufacturing company specializing in cycling equipment and accessories.

The project's main objectives were to:
- Connect and transform raw data.
- Build a relational data model.
- Create calculated columns and measures with DAX.
- Design an Interactive Dashboard to visualize the data.

The project report consists of four key sections:
1. **The Executive Dashboard**: Featuring high-level KPIs, a weekly Revenue Trending Chart, custom tooltips, and a custom filter pane.
2. **Map**: For geospatial data analysis.
3. **Product Details**: To track product performance against monthly order, revenue, and profit targets. It includes Field and Numeric Range parameters for a granular view.
4. **Customer Details**: A deep dive into individual customer performance, breaking down customer profiles and segments.

## Folder Structure

## Project Details

1. **Data Cleaning and Modeling**: I started by cleaning and modeling the data, ensuring that the foundation was solid for our Power BI report.

2. **Separate Measure Tables**: To optimize performance and simplify the user experience, I created separate measure tables.

3. **User-Centric Design**: I crafted the report keeping the end users in mind, catering to the needs of executives, managers, and analysts, ensuring that the insights are easily accessible and meaningful for all.

4. **Dynamic Interaction**: To enhance user engagement, I utilized bookmarks and buttons, making the report highly dynamic and responsive to user interactions.

5. **Drill Through and Tooltips**: To make the report even more interesting, I implemented drill-through features and informative tooltips, allowing users to explore the data in-depth and gain valuable insights.
